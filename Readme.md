## Introduction
Credit risk analysis is a crucial task for financial institutions to evaluate the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the German Credit dataset and predict creditworthiness.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis is the [German Credit dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)), which contains 1,000 entries with 20 attributes, including:
- Personal information (e.g., age, gender, marital status)
- Employment details
- Loan characteristics (e.g., loan amount, duration, purpose)
- Payment history

The target variable classifies customers as either:
- **Good Credit**: Low risk of default
- **Bad Credit**: High risk of default

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
1. Predict whether a customer has good or bad credit risk.
2. Identify key factors that influence credit risk.

## Methodology
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning missing or inconsistent data.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing distributions, correlations, and class imbalances.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Testing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used
This project is implemented using:
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for analysis and visualization.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning and modeling.

## Results
The final model achieved the following performance metrics:
- Accuracy: XX%
- Precision: XX%
- Recall: XX%
- F1-Score: XX%
